# Self Taught Math
This is repo where I learn classical math and move to translated into Python and JavaScript code.
I found a math camp from UC Berkley where they provided the lessons and exams.

The tools that I will use to learn the mathematical concepts are YouTube, Khan Academy and when it gets taugh Chat GPT
