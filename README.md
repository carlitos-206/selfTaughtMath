# Self Taught Math
In my pursuit of knowledge and mastery in the field of mathematics, I am embarking on a journey of classical mathematical study, with the goal of translating it into the digital realm through the mediums of Python and JavaScript. As a challenge to myself, I will take it upon myself to study lessons and exams from a free math camp at UC Berkeley. In this pursuit, I will primarily utilize online resources such as YouTube and Khan Academy, and will only turn to Chat GPT, for guidance if necessary.

The Chem Math Bootcamp will provide me with a foundational framework that will heavily influence my approach towards understanding and application. Through my studies, I will gain an appreciation for the beauty and intricacy of the mathematical universe, and the significance of the fundamental concepts that underpin it. I am committed to pushing myself to the limits of my abilities, and will strive to continuously improve my skills and understanding in this field.
